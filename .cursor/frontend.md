# Frontend Rules – Next.js (App Router)

- Use App Router (`/app`) exclusively
- Default to Server Components; only `"use client"` when needed
- Client Components: for UI interaction, hooks, browser APIs only
- Keep Client Components small and focused
- Co-locate UI with route when logical
- Use `next/link` for navigation; avoid full reloads
- Use `useRouter` or `usePathname` for programmatic navigation
- Prefer streaming and partial rendering
- Optimize images with `next/image`
- Use `next/font` for fonts
- Use Tailwind or consistent CSS framework
- Avoid inline styles except dynamic values
- Components: `PascalCase`; hooks: `useCamelCase`; files: `kebab-case`
- Variables/functions: `camelCase`; constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Absolute imports with `@/*`
- One main export per file
- Files < 300 lines
- UI components must be stateless if possible
- Do not fetch sensitive data in Client Components
- Avoid business logic in UI
- Always handle loading and empty states gracefully
