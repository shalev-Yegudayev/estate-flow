# Frontend Rules – Next.js (App Router)

- Use App Router (`/app`) exclusively
- Default to Server Components; only `"use client"` when needed
- Client Components: for UI interaction, hooks, browser APIs only
- Keep Client Components small and focused
- Co-locate UI with route when logical
- Use `next/link` for navigation; avoid full reloads
- Use `useRouter` or `usePathname` for programmatic navigation
- Prefer streaming and partial rendering
- Optimize images with `next/image`
- Use `next/font` for fonts
- Use Tailwind or consistent CSS framework
- Avoid inline styles except dynamic values
- Components: `PascalCase`; hooks: `useCamelCase`; files: `kebab-case`
- Variables/functions: `camelCase`; constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Absolute imports with `@/*`
- One main export per file
- Files < 300 lines
- UI components must be stateless if possible
- Do not fetch sensitive data in Client Components
- Avoid business logic in UI
- Always handle loading and empty states gracefully

* Use a base font-size of 14px
* Date formats should always be in the format “Jun 10”
* The bottom toolbar should only ever have a maximum of 4 items
* Never use the floating action button with the bottom toolbar
* Chips should always come in sets of 3 or more
* Don't use a dropdown if there are 2 or fewer options

You can also create sub sections and add more specific details
For example:


## Button
The Button component is a fundamental interactive element in our design system, designed to trigger actions or navigate
users through the application. It provides visual feedback and clear affordances to enhance user experience.

### Usage
Buttons should be used for important actions that users need to take, such as form submissions, confirming choices,
or initiating processes. They communicate interactivity and should have clear, action-oriented labels.

### Variants
* Primary Button
  * Purpose : Used for the main action in a section or page
  * Visual Style : Bold, filled with the primary brand color
  * Usage : One primary button per section to guide users toward the most important action
* Secondary Button
  * Purpose : Used for alternative or supporting actions
  * Visual Style : Outlined with the primary color, transparent background
  * Usage : Can appear alongside a primary button for less important actions
* Tertiary Button
  * Purpose : Used for the least important actions
  * Visual Style : Text-only with no border, using primary color
  * Usage : For actions that should be available but not emphasized
